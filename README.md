Dashboard project for PAI 730, Data Driven Management 

About myself: My name is Mary Stottele, and I am an MPA at Maxwell. I am originally from Buffalo, NY. I graduated from Yale University in 2013 with a Bachelor's of Science in Psychology/Neuroscience. I worked as an AmeriCorps VISTA member in Buffalo for 1 year, helping to run a childhood obesity prevention coalition for low-income Buffalonians. I then worked as a New York City Urban Fellow, working for the Human Resource Administration: Department of Social Services, helping to set up the new Office of Client Advocacy and Access, whose goal is to ensure equal access to public benefits for New Yorkers with disabilities and LGBTQI New Yorkers. I am currently applying to law schools, and I hope to work in the federal government, creating poverty alleviation programs. Outside of school, I like to sing, dance, and act.
